## Beginning

When I first learned about Google Summer of Code program I had no idea how to contribute to open source projects. I was, however, really excited to get to know the world of open source software and, eventually, become a part of it. The reason I have chosen SageMath to contribute and apply to is that I wanted to work on something that is close to my field of studies (Mathematics) and (if possible) to one of my areas of interest such as graph theory.
