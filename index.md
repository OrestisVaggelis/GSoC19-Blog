## Beginning

When I first learned about Google Summer of Code program I had no idea how to contribute to open source projects. I was, however, really excited to get to know the world of open source software and, eventually, become a part of it. The reason I have chosen SageMath to contribute and apply to is that I wanted to work on something that is close to my field of studies (Mathematics) and (if possible) to one of my areas of interest such as graph theory. 

## First contribution

Before submitting their final proposals students are asked to make some contribution to SageMath. This contribution can either be reporting a bug, suggesting a feature or fixing an already open issue. I worked on implementing Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the all pairs shortest paths in a (un)weighted (un)directed graph. My work can be found in [this](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27518) ticket which is now closed and merged into Sage.
